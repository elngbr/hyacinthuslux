This integration ensures that each product can be categorized correctly, providing clear information about the type of flower it represents.

##### Enum: FlowerEnum
Purpose: Represents the different types of flowers that a product can be associated with. This enumeration ensures that the product type is restricted
to a predefined set of values, enhancing data consistency and integrity.
