###### NB: The `PrintDocument_PrintPage` method captures the visual representation of the `lvProducts` `ListView` control and draws it onto a `PrintDocument` at specified coordinates (50, 50). It starts by creating a new `Bitmap` object with dimensions matching the `lvProducts` control. A `Bitmap` is an in-memory representation of an image, which allows for drawing operations to be performed on it. The method then draws the `lvProducts` control onto this bitmap using the `DrawToBitmap` method, which takes the bitmap and a `Rectangle` specifying the area of the control to be drawn. Finally, the bitmap is printed onto the print document at the specified location using the `DrawImage` method of the `Graphics` object. 

14. **buttonPrintPreview_Click**: Show a print preview of the product list.

The `buttonPrintPreview_Click` method sets up and displays a print preview dialog for the `PrintDocument`, allowing the user to see how the `ListView` will look when printed. It creates a new instance of `PrintPreviewDialog`, sets its `Document` property to `printDocument`, and then displays the dialog as a modal dialog box, waiting for the user to take an action such as clicking "Print" or "Close".

15. **btnCancel_Click**: Close the form.

## Delivery Form

The `Delivery_Form` class is designed to manage the delivery process within the `hyacinthuslux` application. This form allows users to create, update, and display delivery information, including details about the client, products, quantities, delivery location, date, and delivery method.

![image](https://github.com/elngbr/hyacinthuslux/assets/142832941/cd83b57f-2074-4167-be0b-87498be90fc8)


### Attributes

The `Delivery_Form` class is designed to manage the delivery process within the `hyacinthuslux` application. Here are the key attributes and their usage:

- **Delivery _delivery**:
  - **Purpose**: This private field is an instance of the `Delivery` class. It represents the current delivery being processed or edited in the form.
  - **Usage**: It is used to store details about the current delivery, including the client, products, quantities, delivery location, date, and delivery method. It is initialized when the form is created and populated with data as the user interacts with the form.

- **const string ConnectionString**:
  - **Purpose**: This constant string holds the connection string for the SQLite database used by the application.
  - **Usage**: It is used to establish a connection to the database whenever data needs to be read from or written to the database. This includes operations like adding, updating, or deleting deliveries.

- **int _editIndex**:
  - **Purpose**: This private integer field keeps track of the index of the delivery currently being edited.
  - **Usage**: It is used to determine whether the form is in "edit mode" or "create mode". If `_editIndex` is set to a valid index, the form will update the existing delivery at that index. If it is set to -1, the form will create a new delivery.

- **event EventHandler<DeliveryEventArgs> DeliverySaved**:
  - **Purpose**: This public event is triggered when a delivery is saved.
  - **Usage**: It is used to notify other parts of the application that a delivery has been saved. This event can be subscribed to by other forms or components to perform actions such as refreshing data or updating the user interface.

- **Dictionary<string, int> _remainingProductStocks**:
  - **Purpose**: This private dictionary holds the remaining stock quantities for each product.
  - **Usage**: It is used to keep track of how many units of each product are left in stock. When a delivery is processed, the quantities of the products in the delivery are subtracted from the remaining stock. This ensures that the stock levels are always accurate and up-to-date.


### Constructor

The `Delivery_Form` constructor initializes the form components, sets up the initial list of deliveries, and subscribes to the `DeliveryCreated` event.

![image](https://github.com/elngbr/hyacinthuslux/assets/142832941/d5a3e7d1-5076-480f-96d9-49c4ffb316bd)

###### The Delivery_Form constructor in the hyacinthuslux application initializes the form for managing deliveries. It begins by calling InitializeComponent() to set up the form's visual components. Next, it creates a new Delivery object, initializing its DeliveryProducts property as an empty list of Product objects and its deliveryQuantities property as an empty list of integers. 
This prepares the Delivery object to store the necessary details for a new delivery. The constructor then copies the provided remainingProductStocks dictionary into a new dictionary, _remainingProductStocks, ensuring that the form has access to the current stock levels of products. Finally, it subscribes the ComboBoxCourierMethod_SelectedIndexChanged method to the SelectedIndexChanged event of the comboBoxCourierMethod control, allowing the form to respond appropriately whenever the selected courier method is changed by the user. This setup ensures the form is ready to manage delivery details and handle user interactions efficiently.

![image](https://github.com/elngbr/hyacinthuslux/assets/142832941/efdd3d0e-be60-4396-8eed-e807a33364b9)

p.s Short: we needed the event so that we make sure that the total value of the delivery is automatically changed every time we select a new courier from the combobox


### Methods

6. **ComboBoxCourierMethod_SelectedIndexChanged**: Updates the delivery method and recalculates the total value when the selected courier method changes.
### Subscription to DeliveryEventArgs

The `Delivery_Form` class subscribes to the `DeliveryCreated` event to handle the event when a new delivery is created.

#### Event Declaration

The `DeliveryCreated` event is declared using the `EventHandler<TEventArgs>` delegate, where `TEventArgs` is `DeliveryEventArgs`. This event is raised when a new delivery is created.

#### Event Subscription

In the `Delivery_Form` constructor, the `DeliveryCreated` event is subscribed to the `OnDeliveryCreated` method. This means that when the `DeliveryCreated` event is raised, the `OnDeliveryCreated` method will be called.

#### Event Raising

The `DeliveryCreated` event is raised in the `btnAdd_Click` method after a new delivery is added to the list and database. The `Invoke` method is used to raise the event, passing the current instance (`this`) as the sender and a new instance of `DeliveryEventArgs` containing the delivery as the event data.

#### Event Handling

The `OnDeliveryCreated` method handles the `DeliveryCreated` event. In this example, it displays a message box with the client's full name, indicating that a new delivery has been created.

By following this pattern, the `Delivery_Form` class ensures that whenever a new delivery is created, any subscribed event handlers are notified and can perform necessary actions, such as updating the UI or displaying messages to the user.


## MainForm

The `MainForm` class is designed to manage the main interface of the `hyacinthuslux` application. This form allows users to interact with client, product, and delivery data, and provides functionalities for managing and visualizing this data.


![image](https://github.com/elngbr/hyacinthuslux/assets/142832941/5b9a05eb-ec5e-496a-ba2f-45e82491d971)

## Class: UserControlChart

The `UserControlChart` class in the `hyacinthuslux` project is a form designed to display a chart representing the distribution of couriers used for deliveries. This form integrates a custom user control for drawing the chart and handles the presentation of data in a graphical format.

### Attributes

- **CourierDistributionChart courierDistributionChart**:
  - **Purpose**: This private field is an instance of the `CourierDistributionChart` user control. It represents the custom control used to draw and display the chart.
  - **Usage**: It is used to set up the chart control within the form, providing the data and refreshing the display to show the chart.

### Constructor

- **UserControlChart()**:
  - **Purpose**: Initializes the form components and sets up the `CourierDistributionChart` control.
  - **Usage**: The constructor is called when a new instance of the `UserControlChart` form is created. It prepares the form to display the chart by initializing components and configuring the chart control.

### Methods

1. **UserControlChart_Load**:
   - **Purpose**: Loads the form and initializes the chart control.
   - **Usage**: This method is called when the form is loaded. It sets the location and size of the `CourierDistributionChart` control and adds it to the form's controls collection.

2. **SetChart(string[] labels, int[] data)**:
   - **Purpose**: Sets the data for the chart and refreshes the display.
   - **Usage**: This method takes two arrays, one for labels and one for data, and passes them to the `CourierDistributionChart` control. It ensures that the chart is updated with the new data and displayed correctly.

### Integration with MainForm

The `UserControlChart` form is integrated into the `MainForm` of the `hyacinthuslux` application. The `btnUserCtrl_Click` event handler in `MainForm` creates and displays an instance of `UserControlChart`, passing the necessary data for the chart.

For button "Courier Bar Chart", the implementation for the bar chart is the same, but the implelentation is made in a class. We only create an object of the class "BarChartCouriers" and use the
contructor to pass a generic structure (a dictionary here) with the data of the couriers from the main form. Therefore, the key is the string representing the courier method (from the EnumCourier)
and the integer is the number of deliveries that method is used on.  
##### A particular aspect of this chart (although it a Bar Chart, as used in the user control), it is that for coloring the bars, I use an object of class Random :)

### So every time I click on "BarChartCouriers", a new color is shown for bars:

### Attributes

- **Dictionary<EnumCourier.CourierEnum, int> courierDistribution**:
  - **Purpose**: This private field holds the courier distribution data passed to the form.
  - **Usage**: It is used to store the data needed to draw the pie chart, where the key represents the courier method and the value represents the number of deliveries made by that courier.

### Constructor

- **CouriersDistributionPieChart(Dictionary<EnumCourier.CourierEnum, int> courierDistribution)**:
  - **Purpose**: Initializes the form components and assigns the courier distribution data to the `courierDistribution` field.
  - **Usage**: This constructor is called when a new instance of the `CouriersDistributionPieChart` form is created, passing the courier distribution data needed for the pie chart.

### Methods

1. **OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e)**:
   - **Purpose**: Overrides the `OnPaint` method to draw the pie chart whenever the form needs to be repainted.
   - **Usage**: This method ensures that the pie chart is drawn whenever the form is rendered. It calls the `DrawPieChart` method with the graphics context and the courier distribution data.

2. **DrawPieChart(Graphics graphics, Dictionary<EnumCourier.CourierEnum, int> distribution)**:
   - **Purpose**: Draws the pie chart on the form using the provided graphics context and courier distribution data.
   - **Usage**: This method performs the actual drawing of the pie chart. It calculates the total number of deliveries, assigns colors to each courier, and draws the pie slices and legend.

### Integration with MainForm

The `CouriersDistributionPieChart` form is integrated into the `MainForm` of the `hyacinthuslux` application. The `CouriersPieChart_Click` event handler in `MainForm` creates and displays an instance of `CouriersDistributionPieChart`, passing the necessary courier distribution data.
