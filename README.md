This application helps streamline business operations, making it easier to keep track of clients and products effectively.
## Class: Client
##### Purpose: Represents the customers of the flower shop, storing their personal and contact information.

##### Attributes
clientId: An integer that serves as the unique identifier for each client.
clientFirstName: A string storing the first name of the client.
clientLastName: A string storing the last name of the client.
clientEmail: A string storing the email address of the client.

##### Constructors
1) Parameterized Constructor: Initializes a new instance of the Client class with all attributes,
including validation for the address and phone number. Throws exceptions for invalid values.
2) Parameterless Constructor: Initializes a new instance of the Client class without setting any attributes.

##### Methods
1) CompareTo: Compares the current client object with another client object based on their clientId. This is used for sorting and comparing clients.
2) ToString: Returns a string representation of the client, typically their full name.

##### Custom Exceptions
1) InvalidAddressException: Thrown when the client's address contains the word "Florida".

2) General Exception: Thrown for a specific invalid phone number.


### Class: Product
Purpose: Represents the products available in the flower shop, storing details such as price, name, availability, type, and stock.

##### Attributes
productPrice: A decimal representing the price of the product.
productName: A string storing the name of the product.
IsAvailable: A boolean indicating whether the product is available for purchase.
productType: An enumeration (FlowerEnum) specifying the type of flower the product is associated with.
productStock: An integer representing the quantity of the product in stock.

##### Properties
The attributes themselves serve as properties due to the use of auto-implemented properties in C#.

##### Constructors
Parameterless Constructor: Initializes a new instance of the Product class without setting any attributes.
Parameterized Constructor: Initializes a new instance of the Product class with specified values for price, name, availability, type, and stock.

##### Methods
Clone: Implements the ICloneable interface to create a copy of the current product instance. This method returns an object that is a clone of the current instance.

## Class: Delivery
Purpose: Represents the delivery details for orders placed by clients, including client information, products, delivery location, date, and method. It calculates the total value of the delivery including transport costs.

##### Attributes
DeliveryClient: A Client object representing the client who placed the order.
DeliveryProducts: A List<Product> containing the products included in the delivery.
deliveryQuantities: A List<int> representing the quantities of each product in the delivery.
deliveryLocation: A string specifying the location to which the order is to be delivered.
deliveryDate: A DateTime object representing the date the delivery is scheduled or was made.
deliveryMethod: An EnumCourier.CourierEnum value representing the method of delivery chosen for the order.

##### Properties
1) DeliveryTotalValue: A decimal property that calculates the total value of all products in the delivery by multiplying each product's price by its quantity.
Basically, it computes the subtotal of the delivery (without taking into account the cost for transportation/courier).
2) Total: A decimal property that returns the total value of the delivery, including transport costs.

##### Constructors
Parameterless Constructor: Initializes a new instance of the Delivery class with default values.
Parameterized Constructor: Initializes a new instance of the Delivery class with specified values for client, products, quantities, date, location, and delivery method.

##### Methods
GetTotalValue: Calculates the total value of the delivery by summing the product values and adding the transport cost based on the delivery method.

2) Product: The DeliveryProducts attribute contains a list of Product objects, each representing a product in the delivery.
3) EnumCourier: The deliveryMethod attribute uses the EnumCourier.CourierEnum enumeration to specify the method of delivery, ensuring that only valid delivery methods are assigned.

## EnumCourier Class
Purpose: Represents the different courier methods available for deliveries.
